# Tic_Tac_Toe
Tic-tac-toe, also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os, is a simple two-player game that is often used to teach basic concepts of game design and artificial intelligence. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and each player takes turns placing their marker (either an X or an O) on a blank space on the grid. The first player to get three of their markers in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all of the spaces on the grid are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw. Tic-tac-toe is a relatively simple game that can be played by people of all ages, and it is a popular choice for developing basic AI algorithms because of its simplicity and the limited number of possible moves.
